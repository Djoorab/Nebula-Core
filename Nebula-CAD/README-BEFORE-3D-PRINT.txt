Recommended orientations for printing the components:
- Casing: rotate it 90° around the X axis (generates less supports)
- Cover/Lid: rotate it -90° around X axis
- Atomizer support/cotton holder: rotate it -90° around Y axis

An STL file called "Nebula-Complete" contains all the components with the correct orientation and disposition for printing the full device in a single session.

Recommended printing settings:
- PETG is ideal for humidity resistance, but you can also use PLA. Avoid using ABS which causes skin irritation.
- Enable supports on the build plate.
- 0.2mm layer height with a 0.4mm nozzle. The print doesn't require a lot of precision so feel free to use different settings.
- 20% infill or less
- Use at least one supplementary perimeter to reinforce the strap holder.
